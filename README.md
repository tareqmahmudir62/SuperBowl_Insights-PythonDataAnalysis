Welcome to the Super Bowl Insights repository! Here, we explore the fascinating world of Super Bowl, halftime shows, and the impact on TV viewership. Whether you're a football enthusiast or just enjoy the spectacle, this project has something for everyone.

## Overview
In this repository, we use Python for data analysis to answer intriguing questions related to the Super Bowl:

1. What are the most extreme game outcomes?
2. How does the game affect television viewership?
3. How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
4. Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

## Data Sources
The dataset used for this analysis was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It consists of three CSV files:
- [Game Data](datasets/super_bowls.csv): Super Bowl game data, including teams, scores, and quarterbacks.
- [TV Data](datasets/tv.csv): Television viewership and ratings for each Super Bowl.
- [Halftime Musician Data](datasets/halftime_musicians.csv): Details of halftime show performers.

## Contents
1. Data Exploration: Investigate the distribution of combined points and point differences in Super Bowl games.
2. Viewer Engagement: Analyze how blowout games impact TV viewership.
3. Evolution of Super Bowl: Examine how the number of viewers and household ratings changed over time.
4. Halftime Show Evolution: Discover how halftime shows have evolved, featuring insights into musician performances.

## Requirements
To run the code and explore the insights, you'll need Python and the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks to view the analysis and visualizations.

## Conclusion
We hope you enjoy delving into the world of Super Bowl and gain fascinating insights into its impact on television and halftime performances. Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and add your findings to enhance this analysis further.
